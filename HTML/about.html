            <h3>With over 80 years in the business, we have grown with our neighborhood, and value what the chains
                lack; community, customer service, and keeping the love of music alive. </h3>

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>Pats Music Center is a store that has been a keystone of the Northeast area of Philadelphia, right 
                in the heart the corners of Cottman and Frankford we have been serving our community since 1939. 
                We take pride in where were are from, and the neighbors that surround us. We value little more than
                helping those who we share these streets with, and those who are just passing through.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>During our 8 decades of service, we have built a reputation of knowledge, experience, and care. 
                Pat's is now in its third generation of ownership, and is being ran by three grandsons of Pat himself,
                who are all self proclaimed music nerds. Music runs in our blood, not only do we enjoy listening, and 
                making music, but also passing that experience on to those who wish to make it themselves, whether it be
                through DJing, or by playing the instruments themselves. 
            </p>
            
            
        </div>

        <div class="parallax__layer parallax__layer--deep parallax__group">
    
            <h2>Passion</h2>
            <p>We believe that all music should be celebrated, and thus carry a large range of music styling, and formats
                to provide to those looking for something particular, or something different to dip their toes into.
                If youre looking for CD's, vinyl, digital, or the occasional cassette, we have you covered. We scour
                the area to keep our stock as varried as possible. If there is something that you would like, that we don't
                have, let us know and we will do our best to track it down.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let Pat's be your go-to when it comes to anything music. We may not be the largest place around, but our
                dedication,
                and passion, truly make the difference. Let us show you!
            </p>
